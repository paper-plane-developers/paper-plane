  <summary>Chat over Telegram on a modern and elegant client</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Paper Plane is an alternative Telegram client.
      It uses libadwaita for its user interface and strives to meet the design principles of the GNOME desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paper Plane is still under development and not yet feature-complete.
      However, the following things are already working:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The use of multiple accounts at the same time.</li>
      <li>Viewing text messages, images, stickers and files.</li>
      <li>Sending text messages and images.</li>
      <li>Replying to messages.</li>
      <li>Searching for groups and persons.</li>
    </ul>
